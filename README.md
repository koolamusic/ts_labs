### what is typescript
Typescript is a superset of javascript, therefore any valid js code is also valid ts code

##### Benefits
- typescript uses Strong Typing (using this feature is optional)
- OOP Features (classes, interfaces, access modifiers || public, private)
- Typescript allows you to catch errors at compile time and not runtime.
- Great tooling/plugin support for typescript
- Typescript needs to be transpiled into Javascript to run on the browser
