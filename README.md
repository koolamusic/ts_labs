### what is typescript
Typescript is a superset of javascript, therefore any valid js code is also valid ts code

##### Benefits
- typescript uses Strong Typing (using this feature is optional)
- OOP Features (classes, interfaces, access modifiers || public, private)
- Typescript allows you to catch errors at compile time and not runtime.
- Great tooling/plugin support for typescript
- Typescript needs to be transpiled into Javascript to run on the browser
- You can write the same js code in TS, at least it will always give you warning at compile time.

- Typescript provides static type checking (numbers, strings, boolean, 
etc)
- TS allows to leverage on the capability of Class Based Objects, which 
exists in languages like PHP, C# etc.
-TS is a SuperSet of `Javascript` as Objective C is a superset of `C`
- TS gives us the power of modules and ES6 Features too
- TS uses a syntax closer to Java, Scala and other high level languages
- TS types are `String, Number, Boolean, Array, Any, Void, Null, Tuple, 
Enum, Generics`
	- Any : can be any kind of type
	- Void : No type returned
	- Null : or undefined
	- Tuple : An array with a fixed number of elements
	- Enum : Enumerated values
	- Generics : Type of Constrain

- TS allows to use Classes in an OOP way without the Prototype 
based objects model in Javascript.
